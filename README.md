# Jokester

The idea is drawn from virtual assistants like Siri and Cortana that will actually tell you a joke out loud if you ask them to.
I am attempting to accomplish the same thing with JavaScript in this project.

Features:
* Calls a joke API to get a random joke
* Passes the 'joke' to a text-to-speech API
* User presses the button "Tell me a Joke"
* Get a random joke in audio form back

APIs: <br>
[Joke API](https://jokeapi.dev/) <br>
[Text-to-speech API](http://www.voicerss.org/)
