* The idea is drawn from virtual assistants like Siri and Cortana that will actually tell you a joke out loud if you ask them to.
* I want to be able to accomplish the same thing with JS.
* I want something close to that as my project

Must haves:
* Call a joke API to get a random joke
* Pass the 'joke' to a text-to-speech API
* User presses the button "Tell me a Joke"
* Get a random joke in audio form back

Bonus:
* Different buttons for different categories
